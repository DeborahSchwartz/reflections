What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository creates a hidden file, .git, which includes all the version control information.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a place to put files that have changed, but not ready to commit as a single batch or a logical unit of work. The working directory is just where the files are and the repository keeps a log of all commits in the .git hidden file.
